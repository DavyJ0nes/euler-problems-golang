# Frist 50 Project Euler Problems in Golang

## Description

So I saw this [post](https://blog.usejournal.com/consider-yourself-a-developer-you-should-solve-the-project-euler-problems-ed8d13397c9c)
and heeded the challenge to complete the first 50 problems in Golang.

The thinking is that it will be fun and should make me a better developer
